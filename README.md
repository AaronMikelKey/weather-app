I built this app using the [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org)

Their API has a free version that is limited but works great for personal projects.

If you try to clone this or want to make your own, you will need to add a file called config.js and in that file export an object with your API key in it.

Add the config.js file to your .gitignore file so it's not uploaded to github to keep your API key secure.
